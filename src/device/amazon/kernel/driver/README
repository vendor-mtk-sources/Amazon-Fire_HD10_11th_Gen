Amazon common BSP drivers contain sign_of_life, logger, idme drivers, which are used on
all Amazon products.

This directory contains all common parts of these drivers. For new product, we only pay
attention to platform related implementation.

1) Porting Guide
1. Copy amzn_sign_of_life_rtc.h in sample directory to the include/linux directory in kernel code;
2. Enable related kernel configurations in kernel;
3. Modify Kconfig and Makfile file in kernel to compile the common bsp driver;
4. Build kernel image, symbol links will be created for amzn_sign_of_life.h, amzn_metricslog.h,
   amzn_keycombo.h and amzn_idme.h in kernel_src/include/linux directory.
5. For sign of life driver, need to modify RTC registers, bit mask, shift used for each
   life cycle reason(boot, shutdown, thermal shutdown, special mode reason) in amzn_sign_of_life_rtc.h.
   This driver also contains below features:
   => Support configuring specific life cycle reason in each product, which needs to
   modify each life cycle reason enumeration variable(rtc_boot_reason_t,rtc_shutdown_reason_t,
   rtc_thermal_shutdown_reason_t, rtc_special_mode_reason_t) in amzn_sign_of_life_rtc.h.

   => Implement setting WARMBOOT_BY_SW, SHUTDOWN_BY_SW, WARMBOOT_BY_KERNEL_PANIC by
   register notifier_call in reboot and panic notifier charin, which should work on all products,
   please double check.

   => Support parity check on all life cycle reason RTC bits.

   => Below is the number of each life cycle reason this driver supporting:
      warm boot reason number: 4
      cold boot reason number: 3
      shutdown reason number:  5
      thermal shutdown reason number: 7
      special reason number:   4

6. For keycombo driver, register_keycombo_notifier to do anything necessary at platform side such as
   software long press shutdown implementation.

2) Test Guide
There also has test module for these drivers. Below is the test method:

1. Set CONFIG_AMZN_DRV_TEST=y in kernel configuration;

2. Compile and flash kernel image;

3. There will be below directory and nodes under /proc:
    /proc/amzn_drvs/
        |------idme
        |------logger
        |------sign_of_life

   You can use these debug nodes to test related feature and get help info.
   For example:
   =============================================================================
   /proc/amzn_drvs # cat sign_of_life
   sign_of_life=0

   Help Info:
   echo [index] > sign_of_life to test below items,then cat sign_of_life to check result:
