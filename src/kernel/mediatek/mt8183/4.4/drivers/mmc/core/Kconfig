config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.

config MMC_SAMSUNG_SMART
	bool "Make Samsung Smart Report available in sysfs"
	help
	  If you say Y here, code will be added to retrieve the Smart
	  Report from Samsung e-MMC cards and make it available via sysfs.

config MMC_ASYNC_SUSPEND_RESUME
	bool "Enable MMC/SD/SDIO device to suspend/resume asynchronously"
	default n
	help
	  Enables MMC/SD/SDIO devices to suspend/resume asynchronously.
	  This will take advantage of multicore and improve system
	  suspend/resume speed
